<!--
The <body> consists of a text input of type 'text' with a placeholder of 'Query'
<ul> for an empty unordered list taht will be filled
The file 'large.js' is a JavaScript version of the dictionary from pset5
By including that file, the <script> has access to that WORDS variable
Created variable 'input' and set it equal to querySelector return value, so that I can get a variable poiting to that text box
Adding an event listener, listening for 'keyup' that calls a function whenever that happens
In that function, set an 'html' variable to an empty string ('')
If the user has typed something, iterate over that array of words (for each 'word' of 'WORDS')
If the curent word 'startsWith' the input value, concatenate onto the HTML variable the followin html `<li>${word}</li>`
`<li>${word}</li>` means: add to that 'html' variable another <li></li> tags inside of which is the word that has matched the first few characters
Finally, ask the document to querySelect the 'ul' element, which previously was an empty unordered list, but change its innerHTML to be equal to the <li> tags that have jsut been created
