<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- That's the page's document type declaration. It says to the browser "here comes a web page written in HTML" -->

<html lang='en'> <!-- 'lang' is indicating what human language is presumably going to be used throughout the rest of the page -->
    <head> <!-- It's the top of the page (aka the tab title) -->

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
It's the anguage in which web pages are written
It has 'tags' and 'attributes', basic building blocks of the language

VS Code in the cloud is already running a web server, but we can also start, inside of VS Code, a second web server
For that we need to choose a different port number, a different TCP port that's not already being used by the server itself
To do that, in terminal:
http-server -> The default port is 8080
While it's running, it will keep a log of every entry in the web site.

Anything immediatly after the '<' sign is the name of the 'tag'
The 'en' facilitate automatic translation or search engine optimization (SEO), etc
Even though the HTML tag started with a language attribute, you don't need to repeat that attribute when closing it

These tags should exist in one and only one place (certain locations)
There are other tags that can be user zero or more times in the code
