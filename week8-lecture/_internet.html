Internet is a set of computers that can somehow intercommunicate
In order to get information from A to B, we need to route this information
Routers are computers (servers) whose purpose in life is to route information from one point to another
The software that those servers are running give them the ability to route information
But how those routers make decisions?
For that, they use a language (protocol) called TCP/IP
IP (Internet Protocol) is specifically focused on addressing servers in the world
Every computer has an IP adress, a unique identifier that typically is of this format: #.#.#.#
Each '#' is a number, typically 0 through 255
That IP adress (IP version 4) is 32 bits in total (or 4 bytes). There's also an improved version of IP adresses known as "IP version 6"
Any time you want to send a message over the internet, using the IP protocol, you firs have to make sure you write 2 addresses on the "envelope"
First is the Destination Adress and Second is the Source Address
Routing is these servers "passing off" these "envelopes" back and forth getting them closer to their destination
It doesn't necessarily follows the shortest path, but in real world routers may ideally route data in the fastest way possible
The information (what's inside the envelop) might be fragmented and also addressed with the same addresses
In that case, the multiple envelops should also contain to information to reassemble the data at its destination
For that, there's another protocol called TCP
TCP, among other things, ensures that we aknowledge exactly how many envelopes were sent
It also contain the sequence numbers of the "envelopes" (1 of 4 / 2 of 4/ ...)
'PORT' is a unique numeric identifier for a specific internet service. It's standardized waht these port numers are
Ex:
- To uniquely identify worldwide web traffic, we use port 80 (HTTP) or 433 (HTTPS)
- 25 is commonly used for email
- 53 is commonly used for DNS
So if the sender wants to request a web page, it can assign outside of the destination's IP address, a column and a port number (1.2.3.4:80)
Now the destination knows that the "envelope" is destined for a web server
A single server can handle multiple things. The ports allow servers to distinguish which type of service should be handling the request
Summarizing, TCP/IP allows to uniquely address computers on the internet and to "guarantee" delivery of data between 2 points

DNS (Domain Name System)
It translates domain names to IP addresses (and they can go in the other direction as well)
The internet service provider can recursively ask anotehr DNS server for a domain that is not in their database
Around the world there are 'root servers', a small amount of servers that know all of the .com/.org/gov/ etc
Even if they don't know the exact IP address, they might know the IP address of another DNS server who does haev the answer
The computer might cache or remember these answers.
DNS also provides expiration dates. So the asnwer to "what's the IP addresss for that domain?" expires after a certain ammount of time

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
It gives the computer an IP address when it boots up
They also teel the computer what DNS server to use
They also teel you the IP address of your default gateway, the router that you should use by default to hand one of those envelopes to

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
It governs how web browsers and web servers intercommunicate
HTTPS is the secure version that uses encryption to ensure that when you're visiting a web page, you and only you can see taht web page
The prefixer 'htpp://' and 'https://' are required when using a browser, even though the browser automatically tends to insert those prefixes automatically if the user don't do it
They are used in URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)
https://www.example.com/folder/file.thml
- There might be 0 or more of those folders, and the file name might be explicitly or not
- 'www.example.com' is the fully qualified domain name, a host name
- 'example.com' is the domain name
'.com' is a TLD (Top Level Domain). TLD indicates what type of domain it is.
'.com' means commercial, '.gov' means government, '.org' means organization, '.us' ofr USA, '.uk' for UK, '.jp' for Japan, etc.
If it is 2 letters length, it's a country code, including '.ai', '.tv', '.io'

'GET' is used to get information. It is used by default when you just type a URL and hit ENTER
'POST' is used to send information somewhere else, often sensitive information like credit card, email addresses, password.
So inside of the "envelope" that's being sent from browser to server is a message like this:
GET / HTTP/2
Host: www.harvard.edu
(...)
What's going to come back from the server is another envelope inside of which is a response that might look like:
HTTP/2 200
Content-Type: text/html
(...)


Now on VS, terminal window:
curl -I https://www.harvard.edu/

HTTP/2 200
server: nginx
date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 13:22:05 GMT
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
vary: Accept-Encoding
host-header: a9130478a60e5f9135f765b23f26593b
link: <https://www.harvard.edu/>; rel=shortlink
x-rq: dca5 181 249 80
accept-ranges: bytes
cache-control: max-age=300, must-revalidate
x-cache: MISS

'curl' means connect to an URL. it lets you simulate being a browser
'-I' -> show just the headers
'HTTP/2' -> '2' os the versions of HTTP that the browser is using
'200' -> indicates success (and other numbrs to indicate failure or that something else happened)

right click -> inspect -> network

Using "curl -I http://www.harvard.edu/" we get:
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
(...)
Location: https://harvard.edu/
'301' -> Means that it was moved permanently to that new location above

Using "curl -I https://harvard.edu/":
HTTP/2 301
(...)
location: https://www.harvard.edu/

Using "curl -I https://www.harvard.edu/":
HTTP/2 200
(...)

Browser (in cooperation with servers) will tolerate user typing in only 'harvard.edu'

Another code is 404
HTTP/2 404
Content-Type: text/html
'404' -> The web page simply does not exist = FILE NOT FOUND

'300's usually indicates user's error. they relate to redirects
'500's usually idicates server's error

"curl -I http://safetyschool.org/"
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
(...)
Location: http://www.yale.edu
