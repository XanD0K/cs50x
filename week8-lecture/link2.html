<!--
'a' us a type selector in CSS that targets all <a> tags in the HTML, unless overriden by more specific rules (like the ID selector)
'text-decoration' is for the underline of the link (the default is 'underline')
'a:hover' is a special keyword that the browser knows about. It's a state selector. It's when you are hovering over with the cursor
The '#' symbol indicates an ID
Since we can access 2 sites on that last paragraph, we created an ID for each of them
id="harvard"
id="yale"
That way we can stylize each one of them separately in the <style> tag
#harvard
    {
        color: red
    }
Instead of 'red', we can type it's hexadecimal code
#harvard
    {
        color: #ff0000
    }

ID is meant to be unique. it is a mistake to use it in multiple places.
To use that '#harvard' style elsewhere, jsut transform it in a class (.harvard) and in the <body>, instead of 'id="harvard"', we use class="harvard"
