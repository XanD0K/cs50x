<!--
'form' tag will implement an interactive section on a webpage. Is a way to collect user input and send it somewhere for processing
'action' attribute tells the form where to send the user's data when they submit it
'method attribute specifies how the form's data is sent to destination (defined by 'action')
'method="get"' means the data will be sent as part of the URL, visible in the browser's address bar ('get' is the default)
'name' attribute gives an input field and identifier
'<input name="q" type="search">' means this input's data will be labeled as 'q' when sent to Google If I type 'cat', so q=cat
'type' attribute defines what kind of input the <input> element is ('text' by default). It tells the browser how to display the input and what it does
'type="search"' means it's a text box optmized for search queries
'type="submit"' means it's a button that, when clicked, sends the form's data

'autocomplete' attribute allows browser to remember what was typed (it is 'on' by default)
'autofocus' attribute automatically highlights the search box (just like Google does). You should only have 1 autofocus field
'placeholder' attribute allows the text box to contain any text you want
