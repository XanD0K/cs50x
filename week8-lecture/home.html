<!--
<p> paragraph was changed to <div> that stands for division, which is a generic rectangular region of the page
Useful as those <div>s are, I can help the internet (search engines, AI, screen readers) understand a bit more what I mean for each of those divisions of the page to be
So instead of generically saying <div> we can use 'semantic tags'(HTML tags) that are not as generic as <div> or <p>:
<header>
<main>
<footer>
When search engines or AIs are learning what the page is saying, it could logically give a little more weight to the header and the main part, and less weight to the footer

It is no the best practice to combine the structure of the page with the aesthetics thereof
In other words, its not the best ideia to combine HTML with CSS all in the same place. Creating HTML to structure and CSS to style the page is an ideia
There are technologies that actually do combine HTML with CSS, with the argument that it is easier to maintain the code and understand what is affecting what

There are a few ways to express characters on in HTML
One of that ways is through HTML entities, a special syntax for symbols that aren't easily typed on the keyboard (just like &#169; in the code)


CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that allows to stylizing web pages by specifying how certain tags should be appearing on the screen
Here we have 'properties', a set of key value pairs, just like 'attributes' in the world of HTML
A propertie allows you to specify the color, the margin, the height of something
How to apply properties to elements inside of a web page? There are different ways:
- type selector
- class selector
- ID selector -> we used that on 'link2.html' file
- attribute selector
- (...)
To do that, we need to tell the browser that we want to include CSS in our page
Inside of the <head> of a web page, there can be more.
There can be a <style> tag where you can put some of those CSS properties
Instead of using the <style> tag, you can use a 'link' tag <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
There is another way to stylize web pages: style attributes

In CSS we have key value pairs (key=value)
style="text-align: center;"

CSS properties
"font-size: large;"
text-align: center; (was in each of the <p> (now <div>), and now it's in the <body>)
