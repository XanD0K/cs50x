<!--
In JavaScript you can use JavaScript to query the DOM for specific elements, and then listen to events that might happen with those elements
You don't need an 'onsubmit' attribute

'addEventListener' -> allow to, after the page has been created, to start listening for some special event on that element
That event being drawn from a list (that list of events from 'hello.html' file)

'DOMContentLoaded' is an event that fires when the HTML is fully loaded and DOM is ready
It is added when you want to wait until the whole page has been read into memory
After that, execute the code
Needed because the script is in <head>, before the <form> exists in the DOM


'form.addEventListener('submit', greet);'
Calling the 'form' variable, at method 'addEventListener'
Telling it to add the event listener on the 'submit' event
Whenever that event is triggered, call the function 'greet'
You don't want to call the 'greet' function now, that's why you don't use 'greet()'
Declare the 'greet' function above that code, before it is used

By default, when formas are submitted, the indeed get submitted to the server
To prevent that, when addind an event listener (using the 'greet' function) you're going to be passed in an argument, wheter you want it or not, that you can refer to as 'event' ('e' for short)
It turns out that that argument that get automatically passed in, wheneber the event is triggered, allows to call 'event.preventdefault'
'event.preventdefault' is literally telling the browser: when you get this event, let me do my own thing by alerting the user "alert('hello, ' + name);", but prevent the default behavior (submitting the form)

Instead of doing:
function greet(event)
{
    let name = document.querySelector('#name').value;
    alert('hello, ' + name);
    event.preventDefault();
}
You can do it like that:
function greet(event)
{
    alert('hello, ' + document.querySelector('#name').value;);
    event.preventDefault();
}
That's because you are only using 'name' a single time
The same goes to 'greet'. If the 'greet' function is only going to be used once, you don't need to give it a name

That way, the code:
function greet(event)
{
    let name = document.querySelector('#name').value;
    alert('hello, ' + name);
    event.preventDefault();
}
let form = document.querySelector('form');
form.addEventListener('submit', greet);

Becomes:
let form = document.querySelector('form');
form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    alert('hello, ' + document.querySelector('#name').value);
    event.preventDefault();
});
This uses a variable 'form' to get the one form in the page
Then tell that 'form' to add an event listener for 'submit' event
And you pass an anonymous function (lambda function) that does takes an argument, but does not need a name

But we also don't need the 'form' variable:
document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    alert('hello, ' + document.querySelector('#name').value);
    event.preventDefault();
});

That <script> tag can goes in the head or in the body, although puting it in the <head> without modifying the code might cause error
Right-click - inspect - 'Console' tab
You defined the <form> tag at the end of the code, while calling it in the beggining
For it to work we add:
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
'DOMContentLoaded' -> WHen DOM content has been loaded, go ahead and execute these lines of code defined by another anonymous function

Again, we don't need that <script> tag. See 'hello3.html' file
