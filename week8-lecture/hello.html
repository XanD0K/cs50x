<!--
<script> holds the JavaScript code, just like <style> holds CSS
'let name' -> declares a variable called name
'document' is a build-in JS object representing the entire webpage (the DOM)
'querySelector' is a method that find the first HTML element/tag matching a CSS selector (#name)
'#name' is a CSS ID selector targeting the element with id="name". In that code, returns the <input>
'.value' gets its value
'alert()' is a built-in JS function that shows a pop-up (alert) box with a message
JavaScript defines a function called 'greet' that runs when 'form' is submitted
form onsubmit="gret(); return false;"
The form will no longer submit to the server. It will greet the user (by calling a function called 'greet') and then return 'false' (return false = it never goes to the server)
'onsubmit' -> an event that runs when the form is submitted. It allows to write JS inside of the quotes
'return false' -> keeps the action local, so the page doesn't reload or navigate away

To use that function, we add a <script> tag at the <head> and declare it
Again. It's not a best practice to co-migle 2 languages

<!--
JAVASCRIPT
Conditions, variables and loops are back.
if ( x < y)
{

}
else if (x > y)
{

}
else
{

}

Variables
let counter = 0; // Here we use 'let' to declare a variable
counter = counter +1;
counter += 1;
counter++;

Loops
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{

}
while (true)
{

}


To use it:
1. we put a <script> tag in the <head> of the page (just like <style>), ans inside of that, the raw JavaScript
It tends to be ideal not to co-mingle one language with another.
2. Another way is to put a JavaScript tag with a 'src' element to specify anoteh file/URL from which you want the JavaScript to come
<script src="scripts.js"></script>
3. We can also put a script tag in the body of the page, below most everything else in the page, or a script tag with a file reference therein at the bottom of the page

JavaScript can be very much event-driven:
- blue
- change
- click
- drag
- focus
- keyup
- load
- mousedown
- mouseover
- mouseup
- submit
- touchmove
- unload
- (...)
All those events can happen inside of a browser, and JavaScript can be used to listen for and respod to
