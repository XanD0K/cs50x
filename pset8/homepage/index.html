                <p>
                    I'm Alexandre, 30 years old and I work as an accountant.<br>
                    In my life I've studied law, game design, accounting, but now I'm a CS50 student learning programming to change profession.<br>
                    I'm from Brazil, specifically from the city of Belo Horizonte. Find out more about my city <a href="https://portalbelohorizonte.com.br/">here</a>.

                <h2 class="title">My hobbies and interests</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy playing video-games. That's the reason I've started the gamedeveloper course.<br>
                    I also enjoy listening to music. My favorite genre is 'lo-fi hiphop'. Here's one of my playlists:
                </p>
                <div id="playlist">
                    <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3UAzY5jwWjnFG1XIxAf20z?utm_source=generator" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the past I learned how to play a few instruments: acoustic guitar, keyboard and transverse flute. I don't play those anymore, but I do plan to get back to them.<br>
                    Reading books is something I do on my free-time. I've read "The Lord of The Rings" collection dozens of times.<br>
                    I also love Eastern culture, especially Japanese: animations, food, not to mention the things I hear about how well structured their societies are.
                    For a person that lives in a third-world country, safety and economy of those countries really enchants me.<br>
                    I also like to draw, either with pen and paper, or digital drawing. Check out a few of my <a href="drawings.html">drawings</a>!

                <h2 class="title">My CS50 journey</h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned, I tried different paths in life. While doing a game design course, I learned the basics of C#, so I had a better start in the CS50 course.<br>
                    I'm really enjoying programming and solving problems, so I believe I made the right decision to follow this path.<br>
                    I also set few TODO's during class and during the resolution of problem sets, so after course I'll come back to them (yes, Tideman is one of them).<br>
                    The CS50 course is, by far, the best one I've taken. Despite trying to learn programming about 4 times and not succeeding, now it is just flowing naturally.

                <h2 class="title">My goals</h2>
                <p>I have a few professional and personal ambitions I want to achieve in the following years:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I do want to dive in the programming world, and, later, make a living from it.</li>
                        <li>I want to test myself, with big and ambitious projects.</li>
                        <li>I want to move to Canada. My sister already lives there since 2019, so I want to live next to her.</li>
                        <li>I want to visit Japan. There are lots of regions and cities in Japan that I want to explore.</li>
                    </ul>
