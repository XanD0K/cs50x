Listener's audio aura consists of medium to high energy (0.65906), medium valence (0.484443) and medium to high danceability (0.71646).
That's a listener who enjoys music with energy and danceability, but not excessively. As for valence, it's a mixed state, showing no strong preference for any particular emotion.

Using that calculus might not be the best way to representate the listener. A few hypothesis to improve that:
It doesn't account all other songs he listened throught the year (101 and beyond).
Perhaps the listener forgot a song playing on repeat in mute mode, which made it became one of the top 100 songs, even though it might be a song that he doesn't like that much.
Maybe the listener played few songs heavily in a certain period of the year due to emotiong he was processing, but it was something temporary and didn't reflec listener's taste throughout the year.

Ways to improve it:
Assign weight to songs, or maybe add a buttom that allows users to tag that song for specific purposes.
Separate the calculation by months or other time periods (Spotify already does that), so that it will take in considerantion listener's taste in those specifics periods.
If Spotify defines "listened song" as one that was fully played, it should also be taken in consideration.
For example, the listener might skip a specific song in its last 20 seconds, but it wouldn't be counted as "listened" even though it's a 4-5minutes song.
So Spotify might implement a method that also accounts for songs that were partially listened to.
