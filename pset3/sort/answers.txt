sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It took more time to sort the files 'random' and 'reversed', but it took almost no time to sort the files 'sorted'.
That's because, in the 'sorted' files, the bubble sort only needs to go once through the numbers.
It's not the merge sort because it took more time than the code 'sort2'.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: From the 3 available codes, the code 'sort2' was the one that took less time sorting the files 'random', 'reversed' and 'sorted'.
For the 'sorted' files, it took almost the same time than the code 'sort1', but the program 'sort2' was better sorting the files 'random' and 'reversed'.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: To sort the files 'random' and 'reversed', it took more time than the code 'sort3', but less than the code 'sort1'.
For the files 'sorted, it was the slowest of all three codes.
Also, It took almost the same time to sort the files 'random', 'reversed' and 'sorted'.
With those information I can conclude that 'sort3' uses the selection sort, since it takes the same time to sort all files, even though they are already sorted or not.
